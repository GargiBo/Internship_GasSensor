# ðŸ”¥ Arduino-Based Fire & Smoke Detection System

This project presents a smart fire safety solution built using the Arduino UNO, designed and simulated in Proteus. The system is capable of responding at two critical levelsâ€”initial smoke detection and confirmed fire conditionâ€”by analyzing sensor inputs and activating appropriate safety mechanisms.

## ðŸš¨ Key Features

### âœ… Level 1: Smoke Detected (Early Warning)

**Sensor Used:** MQ-2 Gas Sensor
**Response:**

* LED begins blinking to indicate potential danger
* DC motor activates a fan to help disperse smoke

### ðŸ”¥ Level 2: Smoke + Elevated Temperature (Confirmed Fire)

**Sensors Used:** MQ-2 Gas Sensor + LM34 Temperature Sensor
**Response:**

* Blinking LED continues
* Buzzer sounds an alarm
* Servo motor rotates to simulate activating a water tap

## ðŸ§  System Logic

* **Temperature Threshold:** Approximately 134Â°F (â‰ˆ56Â°C)
* **Servo Positions:**

  * **90Â°:** Normal/safe condition (fan active for smoke dispersion)
  * **0Â°:** Fire condition (simulates opening a water tap)
* **Auto-Reset:** System resets and all components return to default when no danger is detected

## ðŸ›  Components

* MQ-2 Gas Sensor
* LM34 Temperature Sensor
* Arduino UNO
* Servo Motor
* DC Motor (controlled via L293D Motor Driver)
* Buzzer
* LED
* Breadboard & jumper wires

## ðŸ§ª Simulation Details

The entire system was simulated and verified using Proteus. Ensure all sensor libraries and modules are correctly installed within the simulation environment to achieve accurate results.

## ðŸ›¡ Potential Enhancements

* Integration of a flame sensor to increase detection accuracy
* IoT capabilities for sending real-time alerts to mobile devices
* Replacement of servo with a relay module to control an actual water pump
